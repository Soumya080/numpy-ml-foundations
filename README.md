# 🧠 NumPy Machine Learning Foundations

Implementing essential ML & DL algorithms from scratch using **NumPy only**:

- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Backpropagation & MLP
- MNIST MLP (92%+)
- CNNs on MNIST & CIFAR-10
- Optimization experiments
- Mini research-style project

## 🎯 Goal

Build real **Research Engineer** skills:
- Understand the math
- Write clean implementations
- Run controlled experiments
- Document insights like a pro

## 📅 Roadmap

- Week 1: Linear Regression
- Week 2: Logistic Regression
- Week 3: Neural Networks (MLP + Backprop)
- Week 4: MNIST MLP
- Week 5: CNN on MNIST
- Week 6: CNN on CIFAR-10
- Week 7–8: Optimization & Mini Research Project
